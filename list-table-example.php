/*************************** LOAD THE BASE CLASS *******************************
 *******************************************************************************
 * The WP_List_Table class isn't automatically available to plugins, so we need
 * to check if it's available and load it if necessary. In this tutorial, we are
 * going to use the WP_List_Table class directly from WordPress core.
 *
 * IMPORTANT:
 * Please note that the WP_List_Table class technically isn't an official API,
 * and it could change at some point in the distant future. Should that happen,
 * I will update this plugin with the most current techniques for your reference
 * immediately.
 *
 * If you are really worried about future compatibility, you can make a copy of
 * the WP_List_Table class (file path is shown just below) to use and distribute
 * with your plugins. If you do that, just remember to change the name of the
 * class to avoid conflicts with core.
 *
 * Since I will be keeping this tutorial up-to-date for the foreseeable future,
 * I am going to work with the copy of the class provided in WordPress core.
